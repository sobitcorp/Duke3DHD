# Duke3DHD - HD textures and Widescreen in DOS Duke3D

**Requirements:**
* Duke3D (any v1.3 - v1.5)
* A DOS/Win9x machine, DOSBox, or similar DOS emulator

**Installation:**
1. Download the latest release [[here](https://github.com/sobitcorp/Duke3DHD/releases/download/v1.5.1/Duke3DHD-v1.5.1.zip)]
2. Extract into your Duke3D directory. Overwrite ART files at your discretion. Your regular DUKE3D.EXE will not be overwritten.
3. Run DUKE3DHD.EXE

**Removal:**
To run Duke3D without HD textures, simply delete/move/rename the ART files and run your regular DUKE3D.EXE

# HD textures

All but one of the upscaled tiles come from [Phredreeke's Enhanced Resource Pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/enhanced-resource-pack-for-duke-nukem-3d).

See the README in [tiles/](https://github.com/sobitcorp/Duke3DHD/tree/main/tiles#readme) for more information and technical details.
